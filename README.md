In the article I learned that to host or create my own domain I could search for 'web hosting' or 'domain names' in order to find out what domains are out there to code. You can also use GitHub codes from the community to post your public site in the domain. To view the IDE, there is a app such as Thimble to display HTML, Javascript, and etc to be use as display and be treated as if it's a website.
